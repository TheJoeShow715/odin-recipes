# odin-recipes

Ok, this is the area where I summarize the project and the sick skillz I'll showcase along the way. I'm making a website that is going to have an index page, and about page, probably a few other pages dedicated to specific recipes. I'm assuming I'll have both relative and absolute links in the pages, either to other sites, or other pages on my site. I'm going to practice committing in a consistent and structured way with good commit notes. We'll see. The first million of these I try are all going to suck but that's part of learning; I'll pardon myself
